      <p>The INOS project is funded under the Erasmus+ KA2 Strategic Partnerships program and aims at integrating open science and citizen science into active learning approaches in Higher Education. INOS is a partnership of four universities (Aalborg University, Tallinn University, University of Oulu, University of Bordeaux), an SME (Web2Learn) and LIBER the Association of European Research Libraries.</p>
      <h3 id="H1833659">Upskilling through open knowledge activities</h3>
      <p>In its three year duration and among its other goals and activities, INOS aims to expose academic and library staff and students to participatory methods in fostering open science, and consequently upskill them, so that they reflect on updating pedagogical models in Higher Education through citizen science. It does so by encouraging universities and university libraries to co-create and participate in Open Knowledge and Open Innovation activities. In this context LIBER co-organised four Open Knowledge Activities (OKAs) with five LIBER participant libraries and with the support of the LIBER Citizen Science Working Group and the LIBER Copyright and Legal Matters Working Group. The LIBER OKAs aimed at co-creating and debating on citizen science concepts, thus upskilling the participants in open and citizen science.</p>
      <h3 id="H3740432">Towards a Roadmap on Capacity Building on Open Science and Citizen Science for Research Libraries — Co-creating a vision</h3>
      <p>Building up on the project’s overall intellectual outputs and activities, LIBER is leading activities on engagement, awareness raising and fostering policy change. In this framework, LIBER has recently organised two highly interactive vision-building workshops that led to the publication of a report on co-creating a vision for citizen science in higher education. This activity, together with the previous OKAs, are the starting point for a workshop dedicated to research libraries, aiming to co-create a Roadmap on Capacity Building on Open Science and Citizen Science for Research Libraries. The project will wrap up its activities with a report the the final Stakeholders’ Consultation of the project and its final Vision and Policy Recommendations for Higher Education.</p>
