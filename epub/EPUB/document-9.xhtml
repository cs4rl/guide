      <p>Applying standards to citizen science data is important for several reasons. First, the use of standard methods and tools to gather data helps to ensure the fit for purpose property, i.e., that the collected data meets the quality criteria of an intended use. Second, they can ensure that the data collected, validated or analysed in citizen science activities are provided under the appropriate access and use conditions — which hold to the participants but also to others (i.e., any third party that might be interested in re-using or replicating the work). Hence, standardization is essential for data to be reusable in other contexts. Third, the use of (domain-specific) data standards helps to ensure that the citizen science activity covers all important elements (attributes) of the phenomenon under investigation.</p>
      <p>When it comes to specific (data) standards, there are many to choose from. In the context of citizen science projects, this can be considered an asset, because citizen science approaches are very rich and diverse, so that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution. However, a few things should be said about standards and citizen science data, and a few recommendations might help in advising practitioners and managers of citizen science standardisation initiatives.</p>
      <p>Before anything else, the first recommendation is to avoid assumptions about any citizen science activity. It cannot be assumed that a citizen science activity aims at or would benefit from applying a particular standard, or that the participants are interested in data being re-used by others. Instead, the participants of any existing or new project need to be consulted to clarify their intentions and needs. Which (kind of) data will be collected or analysed by the project? For which purpose? What are requirements in terms of data accuracy, spatial temporal coverage? Who should have access to the data collected by the project? Are there any privacy concerns and which agreements need to be put in place to protect those contributing?</p>
      <p>Regardless of the standard(s) that would be used in the project, it is essential to provide extensive instructions about their use, and to make sure standards are really understood and adopted by the different participants. Homogeneous data collection and representation are key for the overall scientific quality of the activity, so adequate training of participants will be utterly important. You can include information about standardisation in your communication strategy.</p>
      <p>The second recommendation is to apply those few standards that indeed hold across any (citizen science) activity — and especially to the data it might create — those cover topics, such as:</p>
      <ul id="L12894811">
        <li>
          <p>Assessment of the need for an ethical review of data gathering and treatment methodologies, including the protection of personal data. Existing forms (for example, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/ethics_en.htm">the dedicated online guide of the European Commission</a>) might provide valuable insights. If required, ethical reviews might take particular attention, for example to control if the people involved are informed in the clearest way possible (i.e., not only being directed to long and complicated legal texts).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A careful assessment of the inclusiveness of the foreseen engagement methods and the way those are communicated. Here, it is important to clarify and clearly inform about conditions for participation but also which barriers this might create to particular communities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The explicit use of standards and, if applicable, of machine-readable data licenses (for example, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> might be used).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Generic elements for describing data sets (metadata, such as Dublin Core) might be used in addition to any topic specific schemes. A first set of elements that are tailored to citizen science are under development <a href="https://core.citizenscience.org/">by the community</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For data exchange and access, it might be assessed if the use of de facto standards for the machine-based exchange of data over the web (e.g., JSON and APIs) would add value to the project. This should include an assessment of the available technical capabilities of the team. In any case, it is also important to ensure that data is provided in ways that are appropriate for the targeted participants.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any additional advice on the use of dedicated standards for data itself has to be put into context. Standards for citizen science data are highly topic specific, for example, different approaches have to be taken when using air quality sensors (see e.g., the <a href="https://www.samenmetenaanluchtkwaliteit.nl/">SamenMeten infrastructure</a> — soon also in English), observing birds (see e.g., the <a href="https://pecbms.info/european-wild-bird-indicators-2020-update/">European Bird Indexes</a>), or collecting and reporting data about litter on beaches (see e.g., <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/europes-seas-and-coasts/assessments/marine-litterwatch">Marine Litter Watch</a>). The odour pollution case description provides some more details for one selected example, but generally it is advisable (third recommendation) to engage with research institutions and/or public administrations that are parts of the dedicated thematic communities, to learn about their standards and if and how those might apply to a given citizen science project. The best entity to engage with will depend not only on the topic, but also on the intended outcome/purpose of the citizen science project. Public institutions, for example, should be engaged if there is an ambition that the created knowledge will affect policy-making – and the right level of administration depends on the intended outreach (local, regional, national, European or global).</p>

      <p>The university library can be a hub of knowledge for working with metadata and data standards. It aids the academic disciplines to identify and introduce existing domain and community dependent metadata standards. Find links and further resources in the DMP part. <a href="http://FAIRsharing.org">FAIRsharing.org</a> collects policies, standards and ontologies from different disciplines that may be useful also for citizen science.</p>

      <h2 id="H8247629">Project Highlight: Defining New Data Standards with Citizen Science</h2>
      <p><strong>The D-NOSES project applies citizen science and co-creation approaches to set new standards for odour pollution — globally.</strong></p>
      <p>The EU-funded project <a href="https://dnoses.eu/">Distributed Network for Odour Sensing, Empowerment and Sustainability (D-NOSES)</a> is an excellent example of the diversity of citizen science and data standards. It addresses odour pollution with the strong aim to influence policies — within countries, the EU and across the globe. Accounting for around 30% of the environmental complaints globally, odour pollution is an unregulated issue in many countries. D-NOSES aims to create scientific references and replicability guidelines for defining new regulatory frameworks. Among others, the project <a href="https://dnoses.eu/d2-1_review-on-odour-pollution-measurement-abatement_v3-2-pdf/">reviewed odour pollution and measurement techniques</a> and <a href="https://dnoses.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/D2.3_Good-practices_v3.1.pdf">compiled a list of good practices in handling odour pollution</a>. A related <a href="https://dnoses.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/D7.4.-MOOC-on-Odour-Pollution.pdf">Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)</a> was developed to support capacity building. The project highlights that citizen science can be an integral part in developing standards, especially in domains where those standards have yet to be defined.</p>

      <p>However, a few particularities should be noted:</p>
      <ul id="L77245431">
        <li>
          <p>In most thematic fields, measurement standards for data gathering and exchange already exist. Therefore, citizen science projects have different starting points;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Regulatory impacts are not always the main driver for a citizen science project. Thus, different standards might be needed to address different ambitions; and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Not all citizen science projects follow the same funding model. Available funds and related timelines do constrain the possibilities to learn to use existing or even to develop new standards.</p>
        </li>
