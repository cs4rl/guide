## Mission statement

The guide is designed to be a practical and compact gateway publication for the
purpose of assisting research libraries to start setting up a Citizen Science
programme.

Citizen Science for research libraries is a way to build new and more engaged
audiences as a way to establish new links between science and society.

The guide will address the unique context of research libraries – as becoming
the ‘go to place’ for the new and exciting Open Science data world that is
opening up to the wider public.

As a starting point the guide will use the four recommendations for Citizen Science
from the [LIBER Open Science Roadmap](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1303002):
infrastructures; good scientific practice; guidelines, and; skilling.

## Contents

The content will be organised around the following four main sections and release in sequential modules for reuse. The top level sections are set but the section contents should be seen as working ideas or suggestions for content.

1.  **Skills:** Citizen Science skills development for staff, researchers, and the public;

2.  **Infrastructures:** As being active in the development of infrastructure for researchers to carry out Citizen Science;

3.  **Good [open] scientific practice:** as managing bodies around knowledge libraries that can translate good [Open Science] scholarly practice into new Citizen Science fields, and;

4.  **Guidelines:** develop guidelines for Citizen Science activities involving the library.

### Glossary 

Start with Simple Knowledge Organization System ([SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/)) terms, then fit to taxonomies, add to Wikidata, then describe. Use as a SEO primer. Here is an [Open Science](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/Dk4aKir9RyO1pi3jwr4Psw#Outline) example.

## Roadmap

First section will be released July 2021, with the publication released as a first full version by the end of 2021.

## Editorial management 

- peer review / roles

**Co-Editors-in-Chief:** Simon Worthington and Thomas Kaarsted, reports to CSWG.
The role is that of content planning and project management – that contributions
fulfill the mission to make a compelling and exciting end product; ensuring
publication review groups and production workflows stay on track. **Duties:**
maintain content outline; organise meeting schedule; oversee technical
production, and; responsible for legal, ethical, and quality guidelines and
standards compliance on behalf of CSWG.

**Editorial committee (can also peer review):** Chair – Paul Ayris, with a
minimum of four members of the committee. The committee is made up of the
section editors. There will be one section editor per section of four sections
(optionally sometimes two section editors). The committee has the final
editorial signoff on content. The role of the committee is content coordination
and commissioning contributions – that sections have enough content, the right
type of content, and that style guides and templates, etc., are being followed.

**Section editors:** The role of the section editor is to oversee that the
content fits the scope and editorial policy. Section editors work with close
support from the Editors-in-Chief and report to the editorial committee with the
content of the section, recruit contributors, and correspond with peer
reviewers. Section editors would ensure that contributors have followed
contributor guidelines.

Section editors are:

1.  Citizen Science research infrastructure – Kirsty Wallis, University College
    London

2.  Good (Open Science) scholarly practice in Citizen Science – Bastian Greshake
    Tzovaras, OpenHumans

3.  Guidelines for Citizen Science programme development in libraries – Paul
    Ayris, University College London

4.  Citizen Science Skilling for Staff, Researchers, and the Public – Jitka Stilund Hansen, DTU Library, Technical University of Denmark, ORCID iD: [0000-0002-5888-1221](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5888-1221) e-mail: jstha@dtu.dk

**Contributor:** A contributor would provide one or two articles in agreement
with section editors following the templates and style sheet of the guide.

**Peer review:** Carry out some parts as Open Peer Review. Made up of people
appointed by section editors. There will be two peer reviewers per section. The
reviews will be selected from – CSWG; editorial committee; external appointees,
and publication partners and collaborators.

**Scientific peer review:** The editorial committee would aim to appoint two
experts in the field as external reviewers.

**Partners:** Bring on contributing partners to the publication as institutional
partners. Primarily these partners would provide and exchange content, as
experts in the field, and be co-producers. These partners could also contribute
resources and be attributed: DOIs, ISBN, profiling, translations, etc. Letters
of agreement would be made with partners.

**Collaborations:** These would orientate around content provision, advocacy,
research and resource provision.

## Notes for editors

- Style guide, and contribution templates

Co-Editors-in-Chief Simon Worthington and Thomas Kaarsted will provide writers
guidelines for you to distribute to contributors.

All character counts are inclusive white spaces.

We would encourage contributors to do the following:

-   To make available check lists or materials used in CS activities and supply
    us with information on these and then we can see how to include them as
    either incorporated check lists or as external linked content.

-   To provide us with visual material to support contributions: photo
    documentation of past events; PDFs of promotional material, videos and video
    links so that we can look at how to creatively include these in articles.

-   References will be typeset as page notes, in a references section at the end
    of the publication, and in a [Zotero Groups -
    Collection](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2420395/cswg/collections/HAJYX37C).

-   If possible use Zotero citation manager in Google Docs and store citations
    in the CSWG Zotero group, see:
    <https://www.zotero.org/groups/2420395/cswg/collections/HAJYX37C>

-   Sections should be thought of as 25 page sections, with 400 words a page as
    a guide.

### Style Guide

1.  Prepare the text in English. The Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition (CMOS) is
    being used as the overall publication style. We will stay close to (CMOS) but not 100% complaint as we have many non/English native writers and stzles vary. Points to note will be:
    1. Use American English spelling if possible. I know it's a pain, but will make more sense to an international and US readership.
    2. Use the [Oxford Comma](https://cmosshoptalk.com/2020/02/11/oxford-chicago-and-the-serial-comma/). Which means the presence of a comma before and or or in a list of three or more items.  
    3. En and em dash policy. Make sure en dashes are used where needed and not hyphens. For em dash use we'll keep with CMOS guidlines for now but maybe change down to a en dash (TBC SW 10 Aug 2021).

1.  Submit the paper in a template in the Google Drive (to be supplied).

1.  The text should have a Title (between 1 and 10 words).

1.  The text should have a headline summary that briefly outlines the content of
    the section (max. 30 words).

1.  For each introduction author submit a name and title and e-mail address.

1.  Please divide the text into sections, with:

    1.  **Headings H2,**

    1.  *Subheadings H3.*

1.  Do not include a Table of Contents.

1.  Use single space for spacing.

1.  Do not use line spaces between paragraphs or for line spacing, instead use
    space before and after paragraph or header.

1. Use single column format.

1. Tables and figures. To be placed in individual files. Tables should serve a
    purpose and display cores data in a brief and structured way.

1. Each Table and Figure should have a number and a brief description placed
    below that correspond with the file. All Figures in min. 600 dpi resolution
    or vector graphic. Please embed figures and also upload to associated Google
    Drive folder (Google Docs have a habit or lowering resolutions.

1. References: Do not list references in the text.

1. A maximum of three core references listed at the very bottom.

1. Use The Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition style for references. All
    references should have an author or organization given first. Also please
    list a DOI for each reference if possible.

    Sample reference:

    Ayris, Paul, Isabel Bernal, Valentino Cavalli, Bertil Dorch, Jeannette Frey,
    Martin Hallik, Kristiina Hormia-Poutanen, et al. ‘LIBER Open Science
    Roadmap’. LIBER, 2 July 2018.
    [](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1303002https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1303002).

1. List references in alphabetical order at end of text.

1. For any additional details please contact the Co-Editors-in-Chief: Simon
    Worthington (<simon.worthington@tib.eu>) or Thomas Kaarsted
    (<thk@bib.sdu.dk>).
    
1. Author and editor profiles. ORCID ORCID iD: followed by 16 digit number and not URL as commonly used. No full stop or comma after ORCID iD or e-mail as to not interfere with both. Link to both and make links active in Gdoc. See example: Section editor Jitka Stilund Hansen, DTU Library, Technical University of Denmark, ORCID iD: [0000-0002-5888-1221](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5888-1221) e-mail: jstha@dtu.dk    

1. Refer to sections numbers with a #. So Section #1 or Section #2.

## Production

The book is intended as a short guide and will be approximately one hundred
pages in length. The publication will be produced in conventional and sprint/dash book sprints, as multi-format and
multi-channel distribution (print-on-demand, PDF, Webbook W3C+, website, eBook, and as a Jupyter
Book – and will be technically designed for reuse, for example in – community
translations or in MOOCs. High quality open standards, metadata, and modern sematic/computational publishing are a priority and research interest of the production process.

Book sections will be released incrementally as they are ready. Ideally the book
will become a community owned publication with regular updates.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge [The Library & Community Guide to Citizen
Science](http://media.scistarter.org/curated/The+Library+and+Community+Guide+to+Citizen+Science.pdf)
published by [SciStarter](https://scistarter.org/) as an inspiration for the
idea for our publication. Additionally [The Turing
Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) from the Alan Turing Institute
is worth mentioning as a community model of open science publishing that we look
to emulate.

## An Open Science publication

The publication will be produced as an Open Access publication and use Open
Science practices – where appropriate – to ensure the research is open and
reusable as possible, including: open data, open standards, PIDs, open peer
review, open source software, and open methods, etc.
