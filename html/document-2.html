      <p>The guide series <em>Citizen Science for Research Libraries</em> is brought to you by the LIBER Citizen Science Working Group. The aim of the publications is to provide access to the new open infrastructures and open science know-how that libraries have on offer for citizen science projects.</p>
      <p>The guide is designed to be a practical toolbox to help run a citizen science project. It has been put together from contributions by members of the research library community and has been thoroughly peer-reviewed. The guide is part of a themed series of four sections based on the <em>LIBER Open Science Roadmap <span class="citation">(Ayris et al. 2018)</span></em> that cover the essentials to support citizen science projects: skills, infrastructures, good practice, and programme development.</p>
      <p>Researchers have been branching out into new areas of citizen science as digital services have pervaded many parts of people’s lives, such as — wearable health tracking; data on COVID‑19, energy, or transport; and for climate change mitigation and monitoring. Research libraries are in a unique position to offer up the frameworks and infrastructures built by the open science movement for wider use by researcher in society. In the guide series we are aiming to share examples of such projects.</p>
      <p>Citizen science is a key pillar of open science. The <em>UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science <span class="citation">(UNESCO 2021)</span></em> for the first time creates consensus on definitions and principles for open science. Citizen science plays a variety of roles in the overall open science endeavour of the <em>democratization of knowledge</em> such as — fostering trust in science, in data gathering and cooperations, and being more equitable — with our guide offering a contribution in capacity building for such values.</p>
