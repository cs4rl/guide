      <p><strong>In citizen science, data is communication. Do not only regard data as the subject matter for analysis but expand it into communicable potential for dissemination. Citizens are curious and want to know how their data is used. Therefore, when designing a project, it is imperative you integrate communication as a tool for dialogue from beginning to end.</strong></p>

      <p>In this section, we focus on communication with citizens. If you want to engage media or journalists this <a href="https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/do-engagement/choose-method/media-engagement" title="https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/do-engagement/choose-method/media-engagement">guide</a> might be useful. Below we suggest two practical tools for operations:</p>
      <ul id="L6608751">
        <li>
          <p>A communication plan</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A communication log</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="H1241008">Communication to and with citizens</h2>
      <p>In citizen science projects, the citizens are more than respondents. They are participants who are invited into a dialogue regarding research. This dialogue can be conducted before, during and after your project [link: project management]. This is in order to create motivation, empowerment and potentially more or better data. Think reciprocity: the citizens donate data, time and energy. They should receive something in return. When designing your communication plan, focus on:</p>
      <ul id="L38035381">
        <li>
          <p><strong>Engage in an ongoing dialogue </strong><em><strong>with</strong></em><strong> the citizens involved.</strong> This can be via social media, your own channels, website, newsletters etc. and also by inviting media and journalists to join the dialogue. At the outset, communicate to citizens about the scope and goal of the project. During the project, inform and give feedback on the volume of data and be open about the analysis of this data, which they have helped provide. Create an authentic dialogue. If the data or analysis provide new or even curious insights (if not final), these stories might be shared and/or posted. Try to communicate in ongoing loops to demonstrate that their data and participation is useful.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Enable an ongoing dialogue </strong><em><strong>between</strong></em><strong> the citizens involved.</strong> Very often citizen science projects create dialogue to collect data and enable co-creation. The knowledge and experiences of participants might be valuable. Therefore, it might make sense not only to think of communication as a transaction between the researcher and the citizen. Try to enable a dialogue between the participants. This might improve motivation, boost the collection of data and their possible interpretation. Think about communities. Virtual and non-virtual. Consider which communication platform would be most appropriate. Social media always plays a vital role today. Again, the more traditional media channels and journalists could have a stake.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="H353590">Communication Plan (Citizens)</h3>
      <p>The plan can be implemented in the accompanying templates. Depending on the scope of the project other elements can be added. When identifying your target group(s), the stakeholder matrix<strong> </strong>might be a first stop. See the next Project Highlight for an example.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>NB: The project might benefit from a communication plan for internal channels in order to target research communities, management, and groups of colleagues, etc.</strong></p>

      <p>In order to maintain overview and which methods and dialogue that work, we recommend doing a log of communication activities. What is communicated to whom and on which channels or platforms. The log will illustrate a progression or lack thereof and can be coupled to the collected data if the project wishes to include that. In the communication plan you write themes and certain angles that can be useful. In the communication log, you have the specific content.</p>

      <p>“<strong><a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/forskningsformidling/citizenscience/soer-i-fritiden/find-en-so">Find a Lake</a></strong>” is a citizen science project at SDU, Denmark, led by associate professor Sara Egemose. The project aims at involving kids in science in their free time. The goal of the project is for the researcher to recruit and educate citizens in collecting data of water quality and insect life to create a dialogue on future research questions. The project employs a range of citizen science components — kits, camps, pop up events, and has an app for data collection.</p>
