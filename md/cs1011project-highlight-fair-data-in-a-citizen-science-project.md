Fangstjournalen is a citizen science project highlighting several of the points
from this section: it demonstrates how good communication, project and data
management create value to citizen scientists and also to scientific data. Learn
how the project manager makes his data FAIR and share data with the citizens in
this short video (Holmstrand et al. 2020). The collected data are relevant for
reuse in projects about biodiversity, behavior and recreation, but also for
national fishery regulation and policy development. Due to the content of
personal data, the database is not shared openly but via a metadata record (Skov
2021).
