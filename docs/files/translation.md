# Translation

Translations will be added at a later stage.

Using the open-source software [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en-gb/ ) crowdsourced translations can be managed with expert translators adding quality control.

All languages can be added and left/right right/left languages can me mixed in documents allowing for annotations.
