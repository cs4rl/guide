Crisis Management

Textbook for Public Health Services

Edited by Ute Teichert & Peter Tinnemann

v1.0, 2021

## Pre-release v1.0

In recent years, crisis management is gaining considerably in importance, in the
public health services in general and in particular since the SARS-CoV-II
pandemic globally. In Germany, decision-making authority for crisis management
of biological emergencies resides in principle with the municipal health
authorities.

**In light of the current situation (as of 31 March 2020) involving the spread
of the novel coronavirus, we are hereby providing extracts from a preliminary
version of our textbook (Krisenmanagement) open-access in English to a global
audience.**

Crisis management tools support staff in the public health services to ensure
that the authorities are able to continue functioning in biological emergencies.
As a rule, normal administrative structures cannot cope with the challenges that
arise in a crisis. Information and communications management for example must be
adapted if it is to cope with increased demands. If sufficient specialist
personnel are not available, competences have to be pooled and provided from a
more central point. This textbook is designed to provide employees of public
health offices, as well as other public health institutions, with pointers on
how to systematically prepare themselves for preventing hazards in case of
crisis, and familiarise them with the basics of crisis management. As well as
covering specialised aspects, the textbook also provides recommendations in
particular on operational planning and working in teams. It is supplemented with
checklists designed and established in practise to serve as practical tools.

The content brought together in this unique textbook is based on the authors'
years of theoretical study and practical experience within public health
services. **This textbook is a joint work of all the authors involved, and does
not represent the opinion of individual institutions or individual authors.**

We are planning to update and expand this textbook in the future. We would
therefore be delighted if you could share with us your suggestions, comments and
additions. We are using [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) for your comments
and additions to our textbook.

## About us

This textbook is based on the Textbook Krisenmanagement (DOI
[10.25815/h0ec-f967](https://doi.org/10.25815/h0ec-f967)), a joint project of
the [Academy of Public Health
Services](https://www.akademie-oegw.de/startseite.html) and the [Open Science
Lab](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/open-science) of the
[TIB](https://www.tib.eu/) – Leibniz-Information Centre for Science and
Technology University Library. Translation from German to English was provided
by Engagement Global gGmbh.

### Funding

The project was funded by the German [Federal Ministry of
Health](https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/english-version.html) (BMG).

The translation of this book into English was supported by the [Connective

Engagement Global, on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

### Open access

This textbook and manual, which is available online free of charge, is designed
as a practical tool for you to use in your daily work. To promote research and
teaching in order to improve public health, it is important that all staff of
public health services, interested professionals and the public at large have
access at all times to the best available knowledge on public health. A printed

### Sustainability and further development

The product of this collaborative writing process has been and will continue to
be supplemented and improved. Here, readers too can also play an active role by
providing their feedback and addenda. The authors of all the texts are conscious
of the fact that the themes covered so far represent only segments of the range
of activities performed by public health services.

Sine this is an agile project that will be continuously developed together with
the Academy of Public Health Services, as well as continuously updating the
existing chapters it will also be possible to add further thematic areas.

### Method

All texts were developed and written using the so-called **book sprint** method.
A **book sprint** is an agile method that enables authors to collaboratively
write longer and more complex texts in a short period of time. All books sprints
were organised and carried out jointly by the Academy of Public Health Services
and the Open Science Lab of the TIB – Leibniz-Information Centre for Science and
Technology

University Library. The book sprint method enables authors to create digital
content on a goal-oriented basis.

It is based on the principles of sharing, co-development, community building and
collective ownership of the product. This open, transparent method has already
been successfully used at several institutions, including the TIB. It is based
on goal-competence profiles defined in advance, on teaching modules that have
been tried and tested in prior teaching settings, and on practical examples of
application (use cases).

Authors use digital technologies to write the content This enables a joint
process of concurrently writing texts which are designed as a single
collectively owned product in their entirety, until then final result is
achieved. Chapters or entire books are written in this manner. In intensive
three-day book sprints we have worked with up to ten experts on a selected topic
Facilitated by a book sprint moderator with experience in media education,
participants create joint content on selected topics related to work in the
public health service.

### How the textbook was produced

This original textbook Krisenmanaement was a joint project of the [Academy of
Public Health Services](https://www.akademie-oegw.de/startseite.html) and the
[Open Science Lab](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/open-science) of
the [TIB](https://www.tib.eu/) – Leibniz-Information Centre for Science and
Technology University Library.

Together with teachers from the Academy, experts from different fields of public
health have been co-authoring texts for this series of textbooks in book sprints
since 2019.

The initial phase of collaborative writing was followed by an editing phase
during which supplemental content was inserted and existing content revised. The
text contributions are based on a broad range of relevant literature, years of
experience gained by long-standing public health practitioners, and experiences
and suggestions put forward by young professionals with an interest in public
health.

In all the textbooks, jointly defined chapters on e.g. history, objectives,
tasks, structures and definitions are described in detail. Each book has been
designed as a comprehensive, self-contained work, and can be read either in
conjunction with the other books or as a stand-alone reference work in its own
right.

The entire textbook series is designed as an Open Educational Resource (OER) and
is published under an open licence. This allows free access, editing and further
processing by others without restriction or with only minor restrictions.

The original textbook in German and the this textbook will be updated and is
available as a printed textbook at a reasonable price.
