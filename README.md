A practical guide designed to assist those organising and participating in a
citizen science project to get the most out of the experience. The guide will
enable you to have the skills to ensure a project is well set up from the start,
is able to communicate to its stakeholders and citizens, manage its data and
outputs, and overall ensure research benefits. The guide has been compiled by
the LIBER Citizen Science Working Group and pulls on the generous contributions
of the open science community.
